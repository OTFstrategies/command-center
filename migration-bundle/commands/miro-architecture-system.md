# System Diagram Templates

Create high-level system architecture. Choose a template:

## 1. C4 Context Diagram
**Command:** `/miro-architecture-system-c4`

System context with users and external dependencies. Best for system boundaries.

**Example:** Application context, integration map, system landscape

---

## 2. Layered Architecture
**Command:** `/miro-architecture-system-layers`

Horizontal layers (UI/Business/Data). Best for N-tier architecture.

**Example:** Web app layers, Clean Architecture, hexagonal architecture

---

## 3. Microservices Map
**Command:** `/miro-architecture-system-microservices`

Services and dependencies. Best for distributed systems.

**Example:** Microservices landscape, service mesh, SOA diagram

Tell the user to choose a template or describe their system architecture.
