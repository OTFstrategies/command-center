# Process Flow Templates

Create sequential process diagrams. Choose a template:

## 1. Linear Flow
**Command:** `/miro-flowcharts-process-linear`

Simple A→B→C vertical process flow. Best for straightforward sequential processes.

**Example:** Onboarding process, approval workflow, simple algorithm

---

## 2. Swimlane Flow
**Command:** `/miro-flowcharts-process-swimlane`

Multi-actor process with horizontal lanes. Best for cross-functional workflows.

**Example:** Order fulfillment (Customer → Warehouse → Shipping), development process (Dev → QA → Ops)

---

## 3. Circular Flow
**Command:** `/miro-flowcharts-process-circular`

Cyclical/iterative process flow. Best for repeating cycles.

**Example:** Sprint cycle, PDCA cycle, feedback loops

Tell the user to choose a template or describe their process.
