# Kanban Board Templates

Create task management boards. Choose a template:

## 1. Basic Kanban
**Command:** `/miro-frameworks-kanban-basic`

Simple 3-column board (To Do / Doing / Done). Best for personal tasks or small teams.

**Example:** Personal task list, feature development, bug tracking

---

## 2. Extended Kanban
**Command:** `/miro-frameworks-kanban-extended`

Full 5-column workflow (Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Review → Done). Best for structured teams.

**Example:** Scrum board, development workflow, support tickets

---

## 3. WIP-Limited Kanban
**Command:** `/miro-frameworks-kanban-wip`

Kanban with work-in-progress limits per column. Best for flow optimization.

**Example:** Lean workflow, limiting multitasking, bottleneck management

Tell the user to choose a template or describe their workflow needs.
