# Roadmap Templates

Create timeline and planning views. Choose a template:

## 1. Timeline Roadmap
**Command:** `/miro-frameworks-roadmap-timeline`

Horizontal timeline with milestones. Best for date-driven planning.

**Example:** Product launch timeline, quarterly goals, project milestones

---

## 2. Now-Next-Later Roadmap
**Command:** `/miro-frameworks-roadmap-now-next-later`

3-horizon planning (Now / Next / Later). Best for flexible, outcome-focused planning.

**Example:** Product roadmap, strategic initiatives, team priorities

---

## 3. Swimlane Roadmap
**Command:** `/miro-frameworks-roadmap-swimlane`

Multi-track roadmap with horizontal lanes. Best for coordinating multiple workstreams.

**Example:** Multi-team roadmap, platform + features, frontend/backend/infra
